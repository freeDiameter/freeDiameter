This package uses CMake (cmake.org) as building system. You'll need the cmake tool in order 
to generate the Makefiles for your platform. You can also select which extensions must be built.

Building in a separate directory is recommended:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

You can enable the unary tests by doing:
cmake -DSKIP_TESTS:BOOL=OFF ../
make
make tests

Note: instead of passing options on the command line, you can use a CMake front-end (for example ccmake or cmake-gui)
or edit the CCmakeCache.txt file directly.

Note that there are dependencies on external tools that may not be enforced by the configure script.
See the specific INSTALL.distro files matching your situation.

make install has not been tested yet and will probably not behave as expected.

You can configure which extensions to build with CMake:
IGNORE_ALL_EXTENSIONS:BOOL=OFF    (or the following are ignored)
BUILD_SAMPLE:BOOL=ON
BUILD_DICT_NASREQ:BOOL=ON
BUILD_APP_RADGW:BOOL=ON
...

You can change the default configuration file pathname:
DEFAULT_CONF_FILE:STRING=/path/to/some/freeDiameter.conf

Build binary with symbols, for debug:
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug

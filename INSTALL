This package uses CMake (cmake.org) as building system. You'll need the cmake tool in order 
to generate the Makefiles for your platform. You can also select which extensions must be built.

Building in a separate directory is recommended:
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ../
# make

You can pass options to instruct cmake about which components to compile on the command-line.
You can also use a CMake front-end (for example ccmake or cmake-gui) or edit the CCmakeCache.txt file directly. 
If your cmake installation is recent, the edit_cache target is a good help as well:
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ../
# make help
# make edit_cache
# make

You can disable the unit tests by doing:
# cmake -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF ../
# make
# make tests

Note that there are dependencies on external tools that may not be enforced by the configure script.
See the specific INSTALL.* files for additional information.

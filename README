freeDiameter is an implementation of Diameter.

Diameter is a protocol designed to carry Authentication, Authorization and
Accounting (AAA) payload. It is an evolution of the RADIUS protocol (as the 
name suggests).

Diameter is an extensible protocol. RFC3588 (currently under revision) defines the
Base Protocol that all Diameter nodes must support, while other documents define
the additional protocol support for specific applications. Such applications include 
for example Network Access Servers (RFC4005), EAP (RFC4072), ...


The implementation consists in several components:
 - libfreeDiameter : the shared library provides the functions to manipulate Diameter
      messages and dictionary. This library is meant to be re-used for other projects
      that would require parsing or manipulating Diameter messages.
      
 - freeDiameterd : the daemon establishes the network connections with other Diameter
      peers and performs the tasks described in Diameter Base Protocol, such as
      watchdogs, basic routing, ...
      
 - extensions : the extensions provide the mean to augment the features of the
      freeDiameterd daemon. Extensions can provide the handling of a Diameter 
      application, but also advanced routing features, peer management, etc.

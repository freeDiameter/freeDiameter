	/* More information about the lists :

	 - the use for each list depends on the type of object. See detail below.

	 - a sentinel for a list has its 'o' field cleared. (this is the criteria to detect end of a loop)

	 - The lists are always ordered. The criteria are described below. the functions to order them are referenced in dict_obj_info

	 - The dict_lock must be held for any list operation.

	 => VENDORS:
	 list[0]: list of the vendors, ordered by their id. The sentinel is g_dict_vendors (vendor with id 0)
	 list[1]: sentinel for the list of AVPs from this vendor, ordered by AVP code.
	 list[2]: sentinel for the list of AVPs from this vendor, ordered by AVP name (fd_os_cmp).

	 => APPLICATIONS:
	 list[0]: list of the applications, ordered by their id. The sentinel is g_dict_applications (application with id 0)
	 list[1]: not used
	 list[2]: not used.

	 => TYPES:
	 list[0]: list of the types, ordered by their names. The sentinel is g_list_types.
	 list[1]: sentinel for the type_enum list of this type, ordered by their constant name (fd_os_cmp).
	 list[2]: sentinel for the type_enum list of this type, ordered by their constant value.

	 => TYPE_ENUMS:
	 list[0]: list of the constants for a given type, ordered by the constant name (fd_os_cmp). Sentinel is a (list[1]) element of a TYPE object.
	 list[1]: list of the constants for a given type, ordered by the constant value. Sentinel is a (list[2]) element of a TYPE object.
	 list[2]: not used

	 => AVPS:
	 list[0]: list of the AVP from a given vendor, ordered by avp code. Sentinel is a list[1] element of a VENDOR object.
	 list[1]: list of the AVP from a given vendor, ordered by avp name (fd_os_cmp). Sentinel is a list[2] element of a VENDOR object.
	 list[2]: sentinel for the rule list that apply to this AVP.

	 => COMMANDS:
	 list[0]: list of the commands, ordered by their names (fd_os_cmp). The sentinel is g_list_cmd_name.
	 list[1]: list of the commands, ordered by their command code and 'R' flag. The sentinel is g_list_cmd_code.
	 list[2]: sentinel for the rule list that apply to this command.

	 => RULES:
	 list[0]: list of the rules for a given (grouped) AVP or Command, ordered by the AVP vendor & code to which they refer. sentinel is list[2] of a command or (grouped) avp.
	 list[1]: not used
	 list[2]: not used.

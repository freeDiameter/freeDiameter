 *   cb2      : If != NULL and in case of PI_SEC_TLS_OLD, another callback to call after handshake (if auth = 1).
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: 
 *   This callback is called when a new connection is being established from an unknown peer,
 * after the CER is received. An extension must register such callback with peer_validate_register.
 *
 *   The callback can learn if the peer has sent Inband-Security-Id AVPs in runtime.pir_isi fields.
 * It can also learn if a handshake has already been performed in runtime.pir_cert_list field.
 * The callback must set the value of config.pic_flags.sec appropriately to allow a connection without TLS.
 *
 *   If the old TLS mechanism is used,
 * the extension may also need to check the credentials provided during the TLS
 * exchange (remote certificate). For this purpose, it may set the address of a new callback
 * to be called once the handshake is completed. This new callback receives the information
 * structure as parameter (with pir_cert_list set) and returns 0 if the credentials are correct,
 * or an error code otherwise. If the error code is received, the connection is closed and the 
 * peer is destroyed.
 * Note that freeDiameter already achieves some usual checks. The callback may be used to enforce

/*
 * FUNCTION:	fd_msg_send, fd_msg_send_timeout  
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *  pmsg 	: Location of the message to be sent on the network (set to NULL on function return to avoid double deletion).
 *  anscb	: A callback to be called when corresponding answer is received, when sending a request (not used with answers)
 *  anscb_data	: opaque data to be passed back to the anscb (or expirecb) when it is called.
 *  expirecb    : (only for fd_msg_send_timeout) If the request did not get an answer before timeout, this callback is called.
 *  timeout     : (only for fd_msg_send_timeout) sets the absolute time until when to wait for an answer. Past this time,
 *                the expirecb is called with the request and the answer will be discarded if received later.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: 
 *   Sends a message on the network. (actually simply queues it in a global queue, to be picked by a daemon's thread)
 * For requests, the end-to-end id must be set (see fd_msg_get_eteid / MSGFL_ALLOC_ETEID).
 * For answers, the message must be created with function fd_msg_new_answer_from_req.
 *
 * The routing module will handle sending to the correct peer, usually based on the Destination-Realm / Destination-Host AVP.
 *
 * If the msg is a request, there are two ways of receiving the answer:
 *  - either having registered a callback in the dispatch module (see fd_disp_register)
 *  - or provide a anscb callback here. If such callback is provided, it is called before the dispatch callbacks.
 *    The prototype for this anscb callback function is:
 *     void anscb(void * data, struct msg ** answer)
 *	where:
 *		data   : opaque data that was registered along with the callback.
 *		answer : location of the pointer to the answer.
 *      note1: on function return, if *answer is not NULL, the message is passed to the dispatch module for regular callbacks.
 *	       otherwise, the callback must take care of freeing the message (fd_msg_free).
 *	note2: the opaque data is not freed by the daemon in any case, extensions should ensure clean handling in fd_ext_fini.
 * 
 * If no callback is registered to handle an answer, the message is discarded and an error is logged.
 *
 *  fd_msg_send_timeout is similar to fd_msg_send, except that it takes two additional arguments "expirecb" and "timeout". 
 * If the message parameter is an answer, there is no difference with fd_msg_send.
 * Otherwise, if the corresponding answer (or error) is received before the timeout date elapses, everything occurs as with fd_msg_send. 
 * Otherwise, the request is removed from the queue (meaning the matching answer will be discarded upon reception) and passed to the expirecb 
 * function. Upon return, if the *msg parameter is not NULL, it is freed (not passed to other callbacks). 
 * expirecb is called in a dedicated thread.
 * 
 *    The prototype for the expirecb callback function is:

/*============================================================*/

/* This file contains the definitions of types and functions involved in the routing decisions in freeDiameter,
 * and that can be called by extensions. 
 *
 * Three different type of messages must be distinguished:
 *  - Messages received, and the peer is final recipient (IN messages)
 *  - Messages received, and the peer is not final recipient (FWD messages)
 *  - Message is locally generated (OUT messages)
 *
 * There are three global message queues (in queues.c) and also peers-specific queues (in struct fd_peer).
 *
 * (*) IN messages processing details:
 *   - the message is received from the remote peer, a FDEVP_CNX_MSG_RECV event is generated for the peer.
 *   - the PSM thread parses the buffer, does some verifications, handles non routable messages (fd_msg_is_routable)
 *   - routable messages are queued in the fd_g_incoming global queue.
 *   - a thread (routing-in) picks the message and takes the decision if it is handled locally or forwarded, 
 *       based on local capabilities (registered by extensions with fd_disp_app_support).
 *   - If the message is handled locally, it is queued in fd_g_local.
 *   - Another thread (dispatch.c) will handle this message and pass it to registered callbacks (see fd_disp_register in libfreeDiameter.h).
 *
 * (*) FWD messages details:
 *   - The process is the same as for IN messages, until the routing-in threads makes its decision that the message is not handled locally.
 *   - If the local peer does not relay message, an error DIAMETER_APPLICATION_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
 *   - All callbacks registered with fd_rt_fwd_register are called for the message (see below).
 *     - these callbacks will typically do proxying work. Note that adding the route-record is handled by the daemon.
 *   - Once all callbacks have been called, the message is queued in the global fd_g_outgoing queue.
 *   - The remaining processing is the same as for OUT messages, as described below.
 *
 * (*) OUT messages details:
 *   - The message are picked from fd_g_outgoing (they are queued there as result of forwarding process or call to fd_msg_send.)
 *   - The (routing-out) thread builds a list of possible destinations for the message, as follow:
 *      - create a list of all known peers in the "OPEN" state.
 *      - remove from that list all peers that are in a Route-Record AVP of the message, to avoid routing loops.
 *      - remove also all peers that have previously replied an error message for this message.
 *   - If the list is empty, create an error UNABLE_TO_DELIVER (note: should we trig dynamic discovery here???) and reply.
 *   - Otherwise, call all callbacks registered by function fd_rt_out_register, with the list of peers and the message.
 *   - Order the resulting list of peers by score (see below), and sent the message to the peer with highest (positive) score.
 *    - in case the peer is no longer in the "OPEN" state, send the message to the second peer in the list.
 *      - if no peer is in OPEN state anymore, restart the process of creating the list.
 *   - Once a peer has been selected, the message is queued into that peer's outgoing queue.
 *
 * The following functions allow an extension to register or remove a callback as described above.

Diameter-SIP implementation is still under development. 

TODO List
* add in malloc the size of char
* when getting results from mysql, check length
* sort capabilities in LIR/LIA
* make functions for database access in MAR/MAA
* order diamsip.h because it's becoming a mess ^^
* replace password in MAR/MAA and libdiamsip from table to malloc char!
* display errors of mysql
* check that all user data inserted in requests are purified
* add accounting server uri in database and diamsip
* add mutex on mysql writing
* check multithreading of mysql!
* get destination host in database for RTR and PPR
* libapp_sip.c: fix username_pure memory leaks
* app_sip_MAR_cb:
  - too much mysql_real_escape_string() use, both within the function and functions it calls
  - on error, leaks allocated: sipuri, username, query.

----- SUMMARY -----

DiamEAP is an implementation of the Diameter Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Application (RFC 4072).
The Diameter protocol is a AAA protocol to securely carry Authentication, Authorization and Accounting information between the AAA client and the AAA server.
Diameter EAP Application is a Diameter application that supports authentication using Extensible Authentication Protocol (RFC 3748).  

DiamEAP is designed to be extensible so that any new EAP method can be implemented separately as a shared library called 'EAP method plug-in'.
Currently, DiamEAP comprises two EAP Methods plug-ins: 
	- EAP MD5 plug-in : implementation of EAP-MD5 authentication method.
	- EAP TLS plug-in : implementation of EAP-TLS authentication method .

Other EAP methods are scheduled to be added in future releases. 	
	
DiamEAP is an extension for freeDiameter. Visit http://www.freediameter.net/ for more information on freeDiameter project.

----- REQUIREMENTS -----

Some packages are required to compile DiamEAP from source.

If you will install DiamEAP on Debian or Ubuntu system install the following packages: cmake flex bison libgnutls-dev libgcrypt-dev libmysqlclient-dev

	$ sudo apt-get install cmake flex bison libgnutls-dev libgcrypt-dev libmysqlclient-dev



----- INSTALLATION -----

1- Add DiamEAP extension to freeDiameter. 
	See freeDiameter documentation (http://www.freediameter.net/)

2-Create a new MySQL database and add tables using the sql script 'diameap.sql'.

3- Edit the extensions/CMakeList.txt file to add DiamEAP to freeDiameter.

Add the following lines:
   
	  OPTION(BUILD_APP_DIAMEAP "Build DiamEAP? (Diameter EAP Application - RFC 4072)" OFF)
	 	IF (BUILD_APP_DIAMEAP)
	 	   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(app_diameap)
	 	ENDIF (BUILD_APP_DIAMEAP)

Note: you can enable DiamEAP to be built with freeDiameter by setting the BUILD_APP_DIAMEAP to ON. If you enable it here you don't need to enable it when building freeDiameter.

4- Enable DiamEAP by enabling BUILD_APP_DIAMEAP option with CMake:

cmake -DBUILD_APP_DIAMEAP:BOOl=ON ../



----- CONFIGURATION -----

DiamEAP requires a configuration file to start the DiamEAP server. 
It is advised to start by a copy of the sample file, and customize the configuration to fit your needs.
A sample configuration file 'diameap.conf.sample' can be find in extensions/app_diameap/ or in doc/ folder of freeDiameter. 
The file 'diameap.conf.sample' contains a description of all parameters that can be added to the DiamEAP configuration file.

*Specify connection parameters to DiamEAP MySQL database:
- username and password to connect to the MySQL Server
- database server : address to MySQL server.
- database name :  database for DiamEAP.

Example:

DiamEAP_MySQL = "UserName" , "MyPassword" , "localhost" , "drupal_ui";


*Add EAP Method plug-ins to be loaded with DiamEAP server. Note that EAP Identity must be add.

Example:

Load_plugin = "EAP MD5":4:0:"extensions/eap_md5.emp":"";
Load_plugin = "EAP TLS":13:0:"extensions/eap_tls.emp":"doc/eap_tls_plugin.app_diameap.conf";


* Enable Authorization with DiamEAP.

You can enable DiamEAP to check authorization of authenticated users. To enable authorization set authorization to 1. ( by default disabled).


* Multiple round trips timeout

This parameter indicates the maximum number of seconds provides the user to answer to a Diameter-EAP-Request. (by default set to 30 seconds)


* Invalid EAP Packets

This parameter defines the maximum number of invalid EAP packets that can be received before rejecting the connection. (by default set to 5 packets)
